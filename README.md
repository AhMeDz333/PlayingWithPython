## CleanProject

CleanProject is a python script which given an android project directory path, finds all the unused resource files and kill them *in liam neeson's voice*

It actually helps shrink the app package size a really big deal.

##Usage
python CleanProject.py \'directory_path\' (plus any number of expressions space separated)
ex -> python CleanProject.py /home/user/MyAndroidProject poster\_\d user.*\d


##Requirements
Python 2.7 or Python 3.0

##Rest of the files
Those are just my solutions to online challenges found at [PythonChallenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/), some cool stuff there!
